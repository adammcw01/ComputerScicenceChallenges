This is a project automating the setup of network booting on two raspberry pi's

A raspberry pi is a small arm-based computer the size of a credit card that can perform any normal task that any computer could do, but with the added abillity to fit is places a convential computer could not.

The system I've put in place takes the complicated task of creating a network bootable setup and automatically configures the server to automatically broadcast the files out across a netowrk making it as simple as connecting another pi to the network.

This allows you more time to worry about creating your peojects while not having to worry about setuping up a troublesome connection between the pi's.
