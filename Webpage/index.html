    <h1>
    Network Booting a Raspberry Pi
</h1>
<h2>
    Why would anyone want to or need to network boot?
</h2>
<p>
    When I say network booting, I mean running a client computer from another
    server computer, where all of the files are stored on the server and there
    is no hard drive on the client. This is useful because it means you can
    manage the computer remotely, you could install new things, restore it,
    update new software all from the server, this is especially helpful when
    you have multiple clients all connected to one server because they can all
    be modified all at once, or perhaps you want multiple devices to all have
    exactly the same data on them.
</p>
<h2>
    That’s cool and all but what use is it in the real world
</h2>
<p>
    In this project I’ve used two raspberry Pi’s which are very small computers
    which can basically fit anywhere and can be modified to create any number
    of things, a popular example of this is kiosks which can be managed all
    remotely from a central server and a huge benefit of this is any sensitive
    data is safe because these are entirely volatile computers. Another simple
    real-world use is when you need a computer in a space you simply can’t get
    to all that easily, instead you could just place a Pi in there once and
    from the server computer perform any tasks you need to.
</p>
<h2>
    That sounds really interesting, but do you not need to know a lot of Linux
    and how to manage networks
</h2>
<p>
    Usually yes, you would, however I have developed a system that will
    automatically setup the server that hosts everything for you, so all you
    have to do is download and run some files.
</p>
<h2>
    How do I set all this up then?
</h2>
<p>
    All the files for this project can be found in a github repository;
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://github.com/adammcw01/ComputerScicenceChallenges">
        https://github.com/adammcw01/ComputerScicenceChallenges
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    To get this up and running you will require 2 computers, a client and a
    server, this project specifically references the use of raspberry Pi’s.
</p>
<h3>
    Client Configuration
</h3>
<p>
    The information surrounding how to setup a raspberry Pi for the client is
    constantly changing with each new firmware updates, some Pi’s don’t require
    any setup whereas others require you to change the bootloader, for relevant
    and up-to-date information regarding your model of Pi please visit the
    raspberry Pi website;

    </a>
</p>
<h3>
    Server Configuration
</h3>
<p>
    This is the part of the network booting process that I have made a
    contribution to, this makes it easier and simpler than ever before. Simply
    download the three python files from the GitHub repository
</p>
<p>
    1. SetupDirectory.py
</p>
<p>
    2. ConfigureServer.py
</p>
<p>
    3. tcpdump-dnsmasq.py
</p>
<p>
    Now on the Pi which you intend to make the server, download and install
    Raspbian
    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/">
        https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
    </a>
</p>
<p>
    Now make sure that the Pi is wired into an existing network and has a
    connection to the internet, on the pi move the three files you downloaded
    earlier on to the desktop and run them as a super user.
</p>
<p>
    If you are unsure how to do this open the terminal, type “cd Desktop”, then
    type “sudo python” and then the file such as SetupDirectory.py
</p>
<p>
    It is very important that you run the files in the order that they are
    listed above, if there are any problems or errors they will appear in the
    terminal window. Don’t be alarmed if the Pi turns off, some steps of the
    program require a reboot, this is totally normal.
</p>
<p>
    Now you’re done, wire in the client Pi into the network and wait for it to
    boot, don’t worry if it doesn’t boot first time, it can take multiple
    attempts to boot successfully depending on the network configurations.
</p>
<h2>
    How does the code work?
</h2>
<p>
    The python scripts work by communicating with the shell to run commands on
    behalf of the user, this allows for the user to run 1 file instead of
    having to manually enter dozens of complicated commands individually which
    in turn opens up endless possibilities for problems when enter those
    commands incorrectly.
</p>
<p>
    The second thing that the code does it write and overwrite files in the
    system to change the settings and configurations, this is possible because
    in Linux everything is treated like a file so the system settings can be
    changed in this way by editing text files.
</p>
<h2>
    Overall
</h2>
<p>
    The point of this tutorial was taking a very complex task which is hard to
    perfect and get working properly every time and create a way that
    simplifies its creation and assists anyone who wants to continue this on
    and create something so that they aren’t struggling on these earlier stages
    like I was before. If you manage to recreate this and get it working I
    encourage you to take it to the next step and create a network booted
    device like the kiosks mentioned above, I would recommend looking at how to
    create python scripts that execute on bootup, that end would be far more
    coding and traditional computer science than the stages laid out in this
    blog post, if you have an interest in networking or want to learn how boot
    processes works or you have a raspberry pi laying around.
</p>
<h2>
    Future Improvements
</h2>
<p>
    The next stages for this project, if anyone wished to extend it on further
    would be;
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Research a way of automatically executing programs upon booting up the
        client
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a large array with multiple clients all being run off of a
        single server
    </li>
    <li>
        Create a system where the client automatically sends information back
        to the server about its current status so that it could potentially be
        monitored remotely
    </li>
    <li>
        Improve the automated setup for the server by including diagnostics for
        it so that the user can see the current status of the server
    </li>
</ul>
